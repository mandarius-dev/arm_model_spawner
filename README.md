# Industrial manipulator - 3D Model Spawner Package
## Foreword
This is a repository that is a part of five that are meant to help in designing a six-degree-of-freedom manipulator.
Repositories:
 1. Source Code Package [[Link][control]]
 2. **3D Model Spawner Package** 
 3. MatLab Scripts [[Link][script]]
 4. Model of the arm [[Link][model]]
 5. User Interface in LabView [[Link][UI]]

## Content 
The repository contains a ROS package used to launch Gazebo with different versions of the manipulator.  Some of the versions work better than others. The final version is `spawn_arm_controll_small_grip.launch` and needs a set of [models][models] to better visualize the full capabilities of the manipulator.
